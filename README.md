  - The project categorizes detected vulnerabilities by their severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low.
  - This categorization helps users understand the potential impact of vulnerabilities, guiding remediation efforts.
- **Educational Tool**:
  - Developers can use this system to learn about security flaws in a controlled, safe environment.
- **Extendibility**:
  - The system is designed with future scalability in mind, making it possible to integrate real-world tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for actual scanning in later iterations.

## Tools and Technologies Used:

- **Python**: The core of the project uses Python to simulate the vulnerability scanning process and generate results.
- **Streamlit**: Used for building the interactive user interface where users can input URLs and view scan results.
- **Pandas**: Used to handle, process, and manipulate data related to vulnerabilities and scan results.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Used for creating visualizations like pie charts and bar charts for the severity of vulnerabilities and vulnerability types.
- **Time**: Used to simulate delays, mimicking the scanning process time.

## System Architecture

The architecture of the Web Vulnerability Scanner follows a modular and layered structure, with clearly defined components.

### Layers of the System:

- **Frontend (Streamlit UI)**:
  - **Input Form**: The user inputs a website URL that they want to scan for vulnerabilities.
  - **Scan Button**: Users trigger the scanning process by clicking the button.
  - **Visualization Area**: Displays pie charts, bar charts, and tables representing vulnerability data.
  - **Results**: Lists vulnerabilities detected during the scan with detailed severity levels and remediation advice.
- **Backend (Python Logic)**:
  - **Vulnerability Generation**: The backend randomly generates simulated vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection, mimicking the process of real scanning tools.
  - **Categorization of Vulnerabilities**: Once vulnerabilities are detected, they are categorized into severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
  - **Reporting**: The backend compiles the detected vulnerabilities into a structured format for the frontend to display.
- **Data Handling**:
  - The backend handles data using Pandas DataFrames to manage the vulnerabilities and generate statistical reports.
  - Results are passed from the backend to the frontend to display in tables and visualizations.
- **Visualization**:
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create pie charts for severity breakdown and bar charts for the types of vulnerabilities detected. These visual elements help users better understand the security issues.

## Vulnerability Scanning Logic

The core of the Web Vulnerability Scanner is its ability to simulate the detection of common vulnerabilities found in web applications. The scanner mimics the actions of a typical security scan and outputs results accordingly.  
Here’s how the scanning logic works:

1. **Input URL**: The user provides a website URL for scanning.
2. **Scan Process**: The system runs a simulated scan by randomly selecting vulnerabilities from a predefined list.
3. **Vulnerability Categories**:
   - **SQL Injection**: Exploits a website’s database layer.
   - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
   - **Command Injection**: Lets attackers execute arbitrary commands on the server.
   - **Path Traversal**: Allows unauthorized access to directories and files outside the root directory.
   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Forces authenticated users to perform actions on the application they did not intend to.
4. **Simulated Data**:
   - Each detected vulnerability is associated with a severity level and an explanation. The vulnerability is then categorized into the severity level:
     - **Critical**: The vulnerability poses a serious threat to the web application and must be addressed immediately.
     - **High**: Vulnerabilities that can lead to serious security breaches.
     - **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that have a moderate impact.
     - **Low**: Minor vulnerabilities that don’t pose significant risks.
5. **Data Presentation**: The results are then displayed to the user using a pie chart for the severity distribution and a bar chart for the types of vulnerabilities found.

## Frontend Design and User Interface

The frontend of the Web Vulnerability Scanner is designed using Streamlit, a Python library that simplifies the process of building web applications. The frontend contains the following key elements:

1. **URL Input Field**: The user enters the website’s URL to initiate the scan.
2. **Scan Button**: Initiates the vulnerability scan once clicked.
3. **Results Area**: Displays:
   - A summary table with the detected vulnerabilities.
   - A pie chart to visualize the severity breakdown.
   - A bar chart to visualize the distribution of vulnerability types.
4. **Real-time Updates**: As the scan progresses, the frontend updates in real-time to show users the ongoing process and the final results.

## Security Considerations

Even though this project simulates vulnerability scanning, it does not interact with live websites or attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities in real systems. The system follows these principles to ensure its secure operation:

- **No Real-World Data**: The system does not scan or exploit actual live websites. It uses pre-generated vulnerability data for simulation purposes.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs (URLs) are validated to ensure no malicious data is injected into the system.
- **Data Privacy**: As no sensitive data is processed, the system does not store any personal information or website data, ensuring complete privacy during the simulation.

## Testing and Validation

The system was thoroughly tested for functionality, performance, and security:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - **Vulnerability Generation**: Ensured the vulnerabilities are generated correctly and categorized by severity.
   - **Frontend Testing**: Verified that the UI loads properly and that inputs are processed as expected.
   - **Data Handling**: Ensured that the vulnerability data was handled correctly using Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Performance Testing**:
   - The system was tested for speed by simulating large scans with a variety of vulnerabilities.
   - Ensured the system can handle multiple user inputs without performance degradation.
